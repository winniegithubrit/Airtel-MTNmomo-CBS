Define Data Models:

Define data models for entities such as User, Account, Transaction, etc.
Determine the relationships between these entities (e.g., one-to-one, one-to-many).
Database Setup:

Set up MariaDB as your database system.
Create tables corresponding to your data models using Entity Framework Core migrations or SQL scripts.
User Management:

Implement user registration, login, and authentication.
Allow users to update their profiles and change passwords.
Account Management:

Include features for account balance inquiry and statement generation.
Transaction Processing:

Develop functionalities for cash-in and cash-out operations.
Implement fund transfers between accounts.
Ensure transaction logging and error handling.
Integration with Airtel Developers and MTN MoMo APIs:

Obtain API documentation from Airtel Developers and MTN MoMo.
Implement API client classes to interact with Airtel Developers and MTN MoMo APIs for cash-in and cash-out functionalities.
Handle authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by the APIs.
Authorization and Authentication:

Set up role-based authorization to control access to different parts of the application.
Implement authentication mechanisms such as JWT tokens or OAuth 2.0.
Frontend Development:

Develop a user-friendly frontend interface for users to interact with the banking system.
Use Razor Pages or a frontend framework like Angular or React.
Testing:

Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual components.
Conduct integration tests to verify the interaction between different modules.
Perform end-to-end testing to validate the entire application flow.
Deployment:

Deploy your ASP.NET Core application to a hosting environment, ensuring that MariaDB is accessible.
Configure environment-specific settings such as connection strings and API keys.
Monitoring and Maintenance:
Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and detect errors.
Regularly update and maintain the application to address security vulnerabilities and add new features.
By following these steps and implementing these features, you can create a robust co-banking system that integrates with Airtel Developers and MTN MoMo APIs for cash-in and cash-out functionalities. Adjust the implementation according to your specific requirements and business needs.
